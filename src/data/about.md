# Some Saying

- "I’m not lazy; I’m just conserving my energy for more important tasks."

# Stories

I usually prefer sharing my stories face-to-face because I'm a bit wary of putting them out there online.

# I like

- Karaoke (singing my heart out in the shower and pretending I’m auditioning for a talent show)
- Dancing (shaking it like nobody’s watching, except for my baby who looks at me like I’m having a mid-life crisis)
- Facebook (mastering the art of procrastination while skillfully crafting status updates that no one reads but everyone likes)
- Tiktok (perfecting the skill of lip-syncing to songs I barely know, all while trying to avoid a viral fail)
- Instagram (curating a feed that’s 90% me pretending to be a fashion model and 10% sunsets)
- Online Shopping (adding everything to my cart like it’s a game)

# Fun facts

- I love to cook. My signature dish is the humble sunny-side-up fried egg. It’s so perfect, even Gordon Ramsay would trade his chef’s hat for the recipe. My kitchen skills are basically limited to this one dish, but hey, why mess with perfection?
- If I could have any superpower, I’d choose time travel. Not just to see historical events, but to go back and witness my past self trying to cook anything other than a sunny-side-up egg. Spoiler: it didn’t go well.

# I dream of

- Filled with inspiration and experiencing the joy of inspiring others.
- Empowering a better future for all, irrespective of political or socioeconomic backgrounds.
- Showing sincere kindness and respect to each person.
- Remaining inquisitive.
- Consistently striving for improvement.
